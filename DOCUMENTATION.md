# Rewardio — Feature Documentation

**Rewardio** is a Music Information Retrieval (MIR) toolbox for analyzing audio session. It extracts musical features from audio files and exports them as CSV for downstream analysis.

---

## Quick Start

```python
from rewardio import Stimulus, Session

# Single file
s = Stimulus("song.wav")
s.process_and_save()              # compute all → CSV
s.process_and_save(timeseries=True)  # also save .npz time series

# Folder of files
session = Session("path/to/folder/")
session.process_and_save()
```

### Loudness

| Attribute | Range | Unit | Description |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| `.loudness_lufs` | −70 to 0 | LUFS | **Integrated loudness** per ITU-R BS.1770-4. Measures perceived loudness over the entire file. −14 LUFS is a common streaming target. More negative = quieter. |

> **What do the numbers mean?**
> - LUFS of **−14** ≈ Spotify loudness normalization target
> - LUFS of **−23** ≈ broadcast standard (EBU R128)

| `.toussaint_syncopation_score_meter` | 0–100 | score | **Meter-aware syncopation score.** Same algorithm but uses detected downbeats and meter for accurate bar alignment. |

| `.pitch` | ~50–2000 | Hz | **Median pitch** across voiced frames (confidence > 0.5). |
| `.pitch_mean` | ~50–2000 | Hz | **Mean pitch** across voiced frames. |
| `.pitch_std` | Hz | Hz | **Std deviation of pitch.** Measures pitch range — low = monotone, high = wide melodic range. |
| `.pitch_conf_mean` | 0–1 | — | **Mean CREPE confidence.** How confident the model is that each frame is pitched. High = clear pitched content, low = noisy/unpitched. |
| `.pitch_conf_std` | 0–1 | — | **Std deviation of pitch confidence.** High = mixture of pitched and unpitched sections. |

> **What do the numbers mean?**
> - Pitch of **440 Hz** = A4 (concert pitch)
> - Pitch of **130 Hz** = C3 (male vocal range)
> - Pitch of **1000 Hz** = B5 (high soprano range)
> - `pitch_std` of **50 Hz** = narrow range; **200+ Hz** = wide melodic movement

| `.key` | C, C#, D, … B | Detected musical key (Essentia). |
| `.scale` | major / minor | Detected scale. |

### Fluctuation (Rhythmic Periodicity)

*Reference: Pampalk, E., Rauber, A., & Merkl, D. (2002). Content-based organization and visualization of music archives.*

| Attribute | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `.fluctuation` | 0 to ∞ | **Rhythmic periodicity strength.** Measures how much the signal fluctuates at perceptually salient modulation rates (~4 Hz, the "groove" frequency). |

**How it works:**
1. Compute a mel spectrogram (40 bands, 23ms frames)
2. Take the FFT of each band → modulation spectrum
3. Weight by the Fastl psychoacoustic model: `w(f) = 1/(f/4 + 4/f)` (peak at 4 Hz)
4. Sum across bands

> **What do the numbers mean?**
> - **0–50**: Low rhythmic periodicity (ambient, spoken word)
> - **50–200**: Moderate (ballads, slow tracks)
> - **200–500**: Strong groove (pop, rock)
> - **500+**: Very strong rhythmic drive (EDM, dance)

### Spectral Irregularity

*Reference: Jensen, K. (1999). Timbre models of musical sounds.*

| Attribute | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `.irregularity` | 0 to ~1 | **Spectral irregularity** — measures how jagged/smooth the frequency spectrum is. |

**How it works:**

For each frame, compute: `irregularity = Σ(aₖ − aₖ₊₁)² / Σ(aₖ²)`

where `aₖ` is the amplitude of the k-th frequency bin.

> **What do the numbers mean?**
> - **~0.0**: Very smooth spectrum (pure tones, sine waves)
> - **~0.1–0.3**: Moderate irregularity (most music)
> - **~0.5+**: Very jagged spectrum (noise, distortion, complex timbres)

---

### Spectral Features (librosa)

These features describe the **shape and distribution of spectral energy** across frequencies. All are computed per-frame and summarized as mean ± std.

| Attribute | Range | Unit | Description |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| `.spectral_centroid_mean/std` | 0 to sr/2 | Hz | **"Brightness"** — the weighted mean of frequencies. Higher = brighter/tinnier sound, lower = darker/warmer. |
| `.spectral_bandwidth_mean/std` | 0 to sr/2 | Hz | **Frequency spread** around the centroid. Narrow = pure/tonal, wide = noisy/rich timbre. |
| `.spectral_rolloff_mean/std` | 0 to sr/2 | Hz | **Energy concentration** — frequency below which 85% of spectral energy sits. High = treble-heavy, low = bass-heavy. |
| `.spectral_flatness_mean/std` | 0 to 1 | — | **Tonality measure.** 0 = pure tone (all energy in one frequency), 1 = white noise (energy spread equally). |
| `.zcr_mean/std` | 0 to 1 | — | **Zero-crossing rate** — how often the signal crosses zero amplitude per frame. High = noisy/percussive, low = smooth/tonal. |

> **What do the numbers mean?**
> - Centroid of **1000 Hz** = warm/dark sound; **4000+ Hz** = bright/harsh
> - Flatness of **0.01** = very tonal (e.g., flute); **0.3+** = noisy (e.g., hi-hat)
> - ZCR of **0.02** = low-frequency tonal; **0.2+** = percussive/noisy

```python
import numpy as np
data = np.load("song_timeseries.npz")
print(data.files)  # list all arrays
pitch = data["pitch_freq"]
centroid = data["spectral_centroid"]
```
